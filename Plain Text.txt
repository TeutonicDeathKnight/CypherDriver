Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be 
done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, 
as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For 
thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. The Lord is my 
shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me 
beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for 
his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear 
no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table 
before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup 
runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will 
dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
